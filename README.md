# Airbnb-s-Data-Visualization-using-Tableau-


In this project, I took a Airbnb's datasets from kaggle and done all the visualization and Dashboard creation using Tableau

This is 2016 Airbnb public listings data. Airbnb is a travel company. Guests and hosts used Airbnb to travel in a more unique and personalized way. The Airbnb dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

ðŸŽ¯ Main goal of this project
âœ¨ To conduct a market research to guide the investment decisions of a potential Airbnb owner. In this project, tableau was used to compare the prices of various types of Airbnb against the size, location and, highest demand time frame.

ðŸ“ˆ Process
âœ¨ In this dataset, there are 3 data tables. I join them (inner join) based on the id. Then I create charts in different sheets. Finally, I add all the sheets to the dashboards.
